<h1 align = "center"> Guess Number </h1>
<p align = "center"> [🎲] - A very simple game based on guessing a random number. Even if it is a very simple application, it remains one of my favourites, being the first to present a graphical interface (in Tkinter).</p>
<h3 align = "center">[⭐]What features exist:[⭐]</h3>
<p> [✍🏼] - Registration based on a name in a database, database based on a .txt file.<br>
[☑] - Possibility to choose a preset difficulty or create your own, below you can see examples:</p>
<p align = "center"> 🟢 - <b>Easy</b> - Pool: 0 - 5, when you win you gain 20 score, and when you miss you lose 5 score<br>
🟠 - <b>Medium</b> - Pool: 0 - 50, when you win you gain 100 score, and when you miss you lose 20 score<br>
🔴 - <b>High</b> - Pool: 0 - 100, when you win you gain 300 score, and when you miss you lose 11 score<br>
🟣 - <b>Custom</b> - You can select both the interval in which the number is generated and the score you can win or lose during the game.</p>
<p> [📈] - The app also features replay functionality when you guess the number, as well as a leaderboard view.
